# Hybrid Search Implementation – Completion Summary

## Overview

The CLI now delivers a production-ready hybrid search workflow for Google Drive content backed by Pinecone’s hosted dense+ sparse indexes with reranking. Owner mode users can index and refresh Drive files, while connected mode users can search existing indexes. The implementation focuses on reliability, observability, and fast feedback through dependency injection and a comprehensive test suite.

## Delivered Capabilities

- Hybrid query path that merges dense and sparse hits, performs document-level deduplication, and reranks results (`gdrive_pinecone_search/services/search_service.py`).
- Integrated embedding support via Pinecone `create_index_for_model`, eliminating local embedding management.
- Rich CLI output showing reranked, dense, and sparse scores (`cli/ui/results.py`).

### Incremental Indexing & Refresh
- Owner-mode indexing and refresh commands share a chunking pipeline with overlap-aware tokenization (`services/document_processor.py`).
- Refresh command tracks `last_refresh_time`, detects new/modified/deleted files, and cleans stale vectors.
- Metadata updates (total files/chunks, refresh timestamps, reranking model) stored in the index for visibility.

### File-Type Coverage
- Centralized definitions for Google Workspace types plus 36 plaintext extensions with category expansion helpers (`utils/file_types.py`).
- Google Drive service detects file types using extension-first logic and gracefully handles inaccessible or empty files (`services/gdrive_service.py`).

### Configuration & Modes
- `ConfigManager` persists owner/connected configuration and exposes environment overrides for chunking and reranking settings.
- `ConnectionManager` validates Pinecone indexes (dimension/metric) and Google Drive credentials.
- CLI commands require owner mode where appropriate and surface actionable error panels.

### Dependency Injection & Testing
- `ServiceFactory` / `MockServiceFactory` enable swapping concrete services for mocks.
- Test suite (76 behavioral tests) targets CLI pathways, file-type utilities, and pipeline flows without external API calls (`tests/`), including cleanup regression coverage.
- Smoke tests verify imports and chunking logic.

## Usage Highlights

```bash
# Configure owner mode
gdrive-pinecone-search owner setup --credentials creds.json --api-key ... --dense-index-name ... --sparse-index-name ...

# Initial indexing
gdrive-pinecone-search owner index --file-types code,config --limit 200

# Incremental refresh
gdrive-pinecone-search owner refresh --since 2024-01-01

# Hybrid search with reranking
gdrive-pinecone-search search "quarterly planning" --file-types docs,code --limit 20
```

## Limitations / Next Steps

- Folder-selection UX and web UI are not yet implemented; the CLI indexes entire Drive content filtered by file types.
- Index auto-provisioning assumes indexes exist; creating dense/sparse indexes via Pinecone dashboard or automation is still a prerequisite.
- Future work may include PDF support, advanced filtering, analytics, and assistant integrations as outlined in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
